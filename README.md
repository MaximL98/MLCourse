# Word2Vec Implementation in Google Colab

This repository demonstrates how to implement Word2Vec using the Gensim library in Python within Google Colab. We'll train a Word2Vec model on a simple corpus, load pre-trained models, and use them to find similar words and perform analogy reasoning tasks.

## Setting up the Environment

1. Install the Gensim library

## Running the Example

1. Download the pre-trained Word2Vec model file `GoogleNewsvectorsnegative300.bin` (3.39GB).

2. Upload the downloaded file to your Google Drive.

3. Mount your Google Drive.

4. Execute the code cells in the Google Colab notebook to train the model, load pre-trained models, and perform word similarity and analogy reasoning tasks.
